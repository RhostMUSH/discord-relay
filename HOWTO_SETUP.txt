- As root: install 'git', 'npm' and 'node' on your server via the package manager (apt-get install git node npm, or yum install git node npm, or zypper install git node npm ...etc..)
- From here on, use your Rhostgame's Linux user on the console!
- As your Rhost game's user, on the linux terminal, run these two commands:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/discord-relay

- This will grab a copy of the code off github. Next, we need to use npm to install all the dependencies.

cd discord-relay
npm install

- Copy the file "~/discord_relay/update_discord.sh" into your ~/<RHOSTGAME>/Server/game/scripts/ directory.
- Run the following command:

chmod 770 ~/<RHOSTGAME>/Server/game/scripts/update_discord.sh


- Edit the file:
-- Change '/path/to/nodejs' to either 'node' or a specific path like '/usr/bin/node'
-- Change '/path/to/discord_send.js' to '/home/<youruser>/discord-relay/discord_send.js'
-- Save and exit the file


- Set uo a so-called 'WebHook' for every Discord channel you want messages from the MUSH to be sent to:
-- In discord, rightclick a channel, select 'Edit Channel'
-- Select the 'Integrations' category
-- Click 'Create Webhook'
-- Click the new 'bot' entry
-- Rename it to 'DiscordRelay' and click 'copy webhook url'. Paste the url into a local notepad along with what MUSH(!) channel should send to this channel


- On the Linux terminal, edit 'discord-relay/discord_send.js':
-- Replace the values in the 'ashcom-channel-name':'DISCORD CHANNEL WEBHOOK' with each channel name and the discord webhook of the Discord channel you want to send to
-- You can make a copy of the line for every different channel, with its own discord webhook. Make sure to keep the comma at the end.
-- IMPORTANT: The channelnames should be all lowercase in this file.
-- Save and exit the file


- Edit your ~/<RHOSTGAME>/Server/game/netrhost.conf
- In this file, set (or add) 'api_port 60601' as a config setting
- @reboot the MUSH.

- In the Rhost, as an Immortal:
-- Change the Uselock on the 'ComSys' object to check for bittype(owner()) instead of just bittype(), and lower the required bittype to 3.
-- Change "[u(F_CHK_CEMIT,%0,%1)]" to "[u(F_CHK_CEMIT,[objeval(%#,s(%0))],%1)]" in the CMD_CEMITNP attribute on the 'ComSys' object.
-- Add "[setq(a,name(%#))][setq(b,[stripansi([r(7)])])][setq(c,[r(1)])][execscript(update_discord.sh)]" at the end of the 'DO_HIST1' attribute of the 'ComSysSIDEFX' object.
-- @power/councilor the 'ComSysSIDEFX' 'EXECSCRIPT'

- Run the following commands:

@create Discord-API
@tag/add discordapi=Discord-API
@api/password #discordapi=THINK OF A DISCORD API PASSWORD HERE
@api/enable #discordapi

- If your Discord channels are named exactly like your MUSH channels, you can simply do:

&CHANHANDLER #discordapi=%0

- Else you need to do something like:

&CHANHANDLER #discordapi=[ifelse(match(WolfDen,%0),public,ifelse(match(New Faces,%0),newbie,%0))]

- Above example would send messages from the Discord Channel 'WolfDen' to the MUSh channel 'public', messages from the Discord channel 'New Faces' to the MUSH channel 'newbie', and other Discord channels that actually match MUSH channels to those.
- Discord channels that do not match MUSH channels and are not handled by this attribute do not send to the MUSH.
- Place the object in a safe room. It does not need to be the master room.


- Now we need to create a Discord Bot!
-- Browse to https://discord.com/developers/applications and log in with your Discord user
-- Click on 'New Application' at the top right, and name it 'RhostBot' or 'YOURGAMEBot' or whatever and hit 'ok'
-- Give it a fancy icon!
-- Select the 'Bot' category
---- Enable 'Public Bot'
---- Enable 'Message Content Intent'
---- Select 'Reset token' and COPY THE BOT TOKEN TO NOTEPAD
-- Select the 'Install' category
---- Uncheck 'User Install'
---- Under 'Guild Install' add 'bot'
---- Under 'Permissions' add:
------ Change Nickname
------ Read Message History
------ Read Messages/View Channels
------ Send Messages
------ Send Messages in Threads
---- Now make sure 'Install Link' is set to 'Discord provided link' and copy the link to a notepad. Save it for later!
---- Open the link in your browser in another tab and then pick your Discord server so the bot gets added to it :)
---- Now DISABLE 'Public Bot' again, as well as its discord link.


- On the Linux Console, edit "discord-relay/discord_receive.js" and:
-- Change the '#50' to this API object's #dbref.
-- Change the 'SomethingSecure' password to whatever you turned 'THINK OF A DISCORD API PASSWORD HERE' above into.
-- Change the 'DISCORD BOT TOKEN' to the BOT TOKEN you created on the discord bot site above.
-- Save and exit the file


- Start the Discord bot with the following command:

node ./discord_receive.js &> /dev/null &

- Enjoy!
